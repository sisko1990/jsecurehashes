PLG_SYSTEM_JSECUREHASHES="System - J! Secure Password Hashes"
PLG_SYSTEM_JSECUREHASHES_XML_DESCRIPTION="For one-way encryption (hashing) of the user's password Joomla! uses the obsolete MD5 technique. The user's password can be saved in a more secure way, but Joomla! doesn't do this, although Joomla! has the possibility. At this point the J! Secure Password Hashes plug-in begins. With this plug-in you can easily switch between the different hash algorithms."

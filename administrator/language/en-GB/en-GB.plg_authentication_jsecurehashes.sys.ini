PLG_AUTH_JSECUREHASHES_XML_DESCRIPTION="With this Plugin you can change the password hash algorithm for you users. Further, you can allow login with only the e-mail address in the username field.<br />As soon as you choose another hash algorithm as the Joomla! default one, the user is switched to the new hash after he logins again in the website. - <em>It may be possible that this first login after the change of the hash algorithm may take some time more as normally.</em><br /><h2>Plugin activation</h2>This plugin will work together with the Joomla! authentication plugin.<br />Therefore the Joomla! authentication plugin (ID: 401) <strong>MUST</strong> be deactivated!<h2>Plugin deactivation</h2>If you deactivate this plugin after changing to another algorithm as the default Joomla! one <strong>NO</strong> user without an "_Q_"MD5-HEX"_Q_"-Algorithm can login anymore.<br />If you will not use the plugin anymore you must set the hash algorithm to "_Q_"MD5-HEX"_Q_" and you must ensure that all users will login again."
